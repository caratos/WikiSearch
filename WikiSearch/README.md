This is the searcher, it loads the models procesed using the minimization of dfa(deterministic finite automata).

There are some WARNINGs which are commented because of the RAM memory available. For the unary model, it can work with 3GB available, the binary can work with 5GB and the trinary model can work with 10GB available.

- Unary is word by word
- Binary is the search of two words
- Trinary is the search of three words

The problem of Binary and Trinary is that the models were not trained with the whole wikipedia so it is mostly like to received a negative answer for each query.

I hope you enjoy it!
